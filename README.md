# Exploring the Operad Structure applied to Welded Braids

This was a project I did in my second year on the operad structure of
welded braids. During this project I learn category theory and learned
a lot about topology and abstract algebra. I think the final report could
be further cleaned up and explained better, however I personally treat it
as a success, especially how much I learned not relating the specific project.
