\textsc{Abstract.} \, This paper defines and discusses the Operad structure, which generalises the composition of multi-linear functions. 
More generally, it admits a composition operation between objects which express some form of self-similarity.

We apply Operad theory to Welded braids, an extension of classical braids which incorporates an ``impossible crossing,'' by allowing strands to cross without passing each other.

Further, we define composition on braids as the replacement of a strand of a braid with another braid. 
Classical Braids form an Operad under this composition.
This essay explores whether welded braids form an operad structure under the generalisation of this composition to welded braids.
